This file sets up a CI/CD pipeline that automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a Node.js app using GitHub Actions and Docker.

Steps in the Pipeline

Trigger:

The pipeline starts when:

You push changes to the main branch.

Or, when a pull request is made to the main branch.

Build Job:

Checkout Code: It pulls the latest version of your code from the GitHub repository.

Set up Node.js: It installs Node.js version 16.

Install Dependencies: It runs npm install to install any required libraries listed in the package.json file.

Run Tests: It runs tests using npm test (though it's just a placeholder for now).

Build Docker Image: It builds a Docker image from your app using a Dockerfile.

Login to DockerHub: It logs into DockerHub using your username and password (stored securely in GitHub Secrets).

Push Docker Image: It pushes the built Docker image to DockerHub, making it available for deployment.

Deploy Job:

Checkout Code Again: It checks out the code again for deployment.

Deploy to Server: It connects to your remote server via SSH, pulls the Docker image from DockerHub, and runs the app in a Docker container.

What This Achieves
Automation: Every time you make changes to the code, this pipeline automatically builds, tests, and deploys the app, saving you time.

Consistency: It ensures that the same steps (build, test, deploy) are done each time, reducing human error.

Deployment: After the app is tested and built, it's deployed to your server automatically.
